# Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank.
# A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale
# from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

# The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]),
# and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

# The task is to find their comparison points by comparing
# a[0] with b[0],
# a[1] with b[1], and
# a[2] with b[2].

# If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

# Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
# Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.
